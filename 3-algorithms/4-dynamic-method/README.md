# Dynamic Method 

Dynamic Programming refers to a very large class of algorithms. The idea is to break a large problem down (if possible) into incremental steps so that, at any given stage, optimal solutions are known to sub-problems. When the technique is applicable, this condition can be extended incrementally without having to alter previously computed optimal solutions to subproblems.

The image above says a lot about Dynamic Programming. So, is repeating the things for which you already have the answer, a good thing ? A programmer would disagree. That's what Dynamic Programming is about. To always remember answers to the sub-problems you've already solved.

## Majority of the Dynamic Programming problems can be categorized into two types:

1. Optimization problems.
2. Combinatorial problems.

The optimization problems expect you to select a feasible solution, so that the value of the required function is minimized or maximized. Combinatorial problems expect you to figure out the number of ways to do something, or the probability of some event happening.

## Where Dynamic Approach is used :

## Example
Insertion sort is an example of dynamic programming, selection sort is an example of greedy algorithms,Merge Sort and Quick Sort are example of divide and conquer. So, different categories of algorithms may be used for accomplishing the same goal - in this case, sorting.
