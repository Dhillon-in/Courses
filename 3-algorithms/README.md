# Algorithm

An algorithm (pronounced AL-go-rith-um) is a procedure or formula for solving a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. A computer program can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm. In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem.

In this section u will cover the following topics 

1. [Sorting Algorithms](3-algoritms\1-sorting)
2. [Searching Algorithms](3-algoritms\2-searching)
3. [Greedy Method](3-algoritms\3-greedy-method)
4. [Dynamic Method](3-algoritms\4-dynamic-method)


## For an algorithm to be useful, it must satisfy five properties:
1. The inputs must be specified.
2. The outputs must be specified.
3. Definiteness - Definiteness means every statement of the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.

4. Finiteness - Finiteness means every algorithm should lead to some solution after certain number of steps.
5. Effectiveness - All operations to be performed must be sufficiently basic that they can be done exactly and in finite length.

## Example Algorithms
Let us first take an example of a real-life situation for creating algorithm. Here is the algorithm for going to the market to purchase a pen.

**Step 4 in this algorithm is in itself a complete task and separate algorithm can be written for it.** 

Let us now create an algorithm to check whether a number is positive or negative.
