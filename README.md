## [Data Structures](2-datastructure)

  You may be new to Data Structure or you have already Studied and Implemented Data Structures but still you feel you need to learn more about Data Structure in detail. Every Data Structure is discussed, analysed and implemented with a Practical line-by-line coding.


1. Linked List :: [Code](linklist.c)

2. Doublylinklist ::   [Code](doublylinklist.c)

3. Graph :: [Code](graph.c)

4. Heap ::   [Code](heap.c)   

5. Queue ::   [Code](queue.c)

6. Stack ::   [Code](stack.c)

7. Trees ::  [Code](treetraversal.c)

 ## [Algorithms](3-algorithms)  
 
Apply basic algorithmic techniques such as greedy algorithms, searching, sorting and dynamic programming to solve programming challenges.
Apply graph and string algorithms to solve real-world challenges: finding shortest paths.

## [Sorting](3-algorithms\sorting)

1. Selection sort :: [Code](selection.c)

2. Insertion sort :: [Code](insertion.c)

3. Bubble sort :: [Code](bubble.c)

4. Quick sort :: [Code](quick.c)   

5. Merge sort :: [Code](merge.c)

6. Radix sort :: [Code](radix.c)

7. Count sort :: [Code](count.c)

## [Searching](3-algorithms\searching)

1. Linear search :: [Code](linear-search.c)

2. Binary search :: [Code](binary-search.c)

3. BFS :: [Code](breadth-first-search.c)

4. DFS :: [Code](depth-first-search.c)

 ## [Greedy Method](3-algorithms\greedy-method)

1. Dijkstra algoritm :: [Code](dijkstra.c)

2. Kruskal's algorithm :: [Code](kruskal.c)

3. Prim's algorithm :: [Code](prims.c)

## [Dynamic Method](3-algorithms\dynamic-method)

Files will be added soon.

2. [Repository](repository.md)


3. [Clone](clone.md)


4. [Commit](commit.md)
   

5. [Pull and Push](pull-and-push.md)


6. [Branch](branch.md)


7. [Creating PR](creatingPR.md)

8. [Merge](merge.md)

9. [Fork](fork.md)
