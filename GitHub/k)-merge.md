# Merge


Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.

A merge can be done automatically via a Pull Request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line. 

By now you should be equipped with knowledge of Git and GitHub top terminologies and features of which you should hopefully start putting into practice. Of course, there are plenty of other rich features of GitHub especially, which we implore you to discover on your own.
