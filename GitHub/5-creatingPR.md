# Pull request

Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the master branch only contains finished and approved work.

Steps to generate a pull request are as follow:
   1. Find a project you want to contribute to.
   2. Fork it.
   3. Clone it to your local system.
   4. Make a new branch.
   5. Make your changes.
   6. Push it back to your repo.
   7.  Click the Compare & pull request button.
   8. Click Create pull request to open a new pull request.
