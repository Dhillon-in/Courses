# Merge

A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. However, when there are conflicting changes on the same lines, a “merge conflict” occurs because Git doesn't know which code to keep and which to discard.

## How to Reduce Merge Conflicts:

1. Sending pull requests to GitHub
2. Fetching remote changes from GitHub
3. Attempting to merge and rebase

I have also added some helpful information about how to set up your mergetool, should you desire to do so. Before I conclude, I want to save you some future headaches by showing you how to reduce the number of merge conflicts you generate in the first place. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure. Here are three useful steps to help reduce merge conflict headaches you may have. Bear in mind, though: merge conflicts are inevitable. You can decrease them, but you can never fully eliminate them.
